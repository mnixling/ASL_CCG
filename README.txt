The files in this repository were created for a thesis. The thesis document can be found at https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/8407/.
All the data was downloaded from http://secrets.rutgers.edu/dai/queryPages/querySelection.php. This is the National Center for Sign Language and Gesture Resources (NCSLGR) Corpus. This is a corpus of American Sign Language. It was developed under the American Sign Language Linguistic Research Project at Boston University under Dr. Carol Neidle.

The Python scripts in the "corpus_data_extraction_scripts" folder require the XML files contained in the "ncslgr-xml" folder. The XML files serve as input for the Python scripts. These Python scripts will extract all the ASL gloss from the corpus. The extracted gloss can then be used as input for the Python scripts in the "openccg_scripts" folder. These scripts build a Combinatory Categorial Grammar grammar of ASL. The constructed grammar can then be used by the OpenCCG Parser (http://openccg.sourceforge.net/). OpenCCG will parse the NCSLGR Corpus and generate CCG derivational parses of American Sign Language.
